# Decision_tree
This project is done as a part of my data science learning journey,
where I completed IBM Data science course on edX. 


Project focuses 


using decision tree classifier algorithm to build a model from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then uses the trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
